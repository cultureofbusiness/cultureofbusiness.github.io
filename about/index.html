		<div class="title">Our Story</div>
		<div class="subtitle" style="max-width:700px; margin-top:2.5rem; text-align:left;">
			Culture of Business was founded in April of 2025, but the idea took root long beforehand. Us three have been collaborators for years, and we’ve always been people who want to learn about how NYC works.<br><br>
			Us three, being from different backgrounds – Chinese, Indian, German – wanted to hold a club that was like a TED Talk: each meeting, one person presents a unique country and how its culture affects its business. And yet, we had to balance the need for discussion.<br><br>
			So we changed the idea: each month, the club focuses on a specific economic sector of NYC. This month, we’re talking about software in NYC. At our biweekly meetings, we go through discussion-prompting slideshows primarily designed by our Operations Manager, holding seminars to reap the gold mine of ideas we all have. At the end of each month, our Managing Editor supervises creation of an article: an objective, unbiased look at that economic sector.<br>
			<br>As President, I oversee and shape every part of this process – from choosing the monthly theme to editing final drafts to guiding our discussions at meetings. My role, while central, isn’t to direct: I’m the throughline that ensures our ideas don’t just stay interesting, but become meaningful.<br><br>
			Before I get going, I should let you know: we don’t just discuss, we compete. My Chief and Assistant Editors aren’t just capable writers: we tackle the technicalities as well.<br><br>
			Thanks so much for stopping by – Josh.

			<b>President: Joshua Liu</b><br>
			Josh is a Senior in the Finance Major at Brooklyn Tech. He spearheaded the founding of COB to further his exploration of the world of business and economics, and to practice his leadership. How one economic sector outdoes another, how one country positions itself as more economically impactful in a certain industry, and how we can use these insights to make a better place – Josh knows that these answers can’t be answered in plain language, but he’s chasing them as best he can. His Presidential activities cover a wide range: leading discussions, delegating editing duties, and leading the team in competitions, just to name a few.  <br><br>
