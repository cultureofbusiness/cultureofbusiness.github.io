		<div class="title">Our Story</div>
		<div class="subtitle" style="max-width:700px; margin-top:2.5rem; text-align:left;">
			Culture of Business was founded in April of 2025, but the idea took root long beforehand. Us three have been collaborators since our first years of high school, and even farther back; and we’ve always been aware of the intangibilities of economics.<br><br>
			Us three, being from different backgrounds – Chinese, Indian, German – wanted to hold a club that was like a TED Talk show: each meeting, one person presents a unique country and how its culture affects its business. And yet, we had to balance the need for discussion.<br><br>
			Each month, the club focuses on a specific economic sector of NYC: this month, we’re talking about Infrastructural Development. At our biweekly meetings, we go through discussion-prompting slideshows primarily designed by our Operations Manager, holding seminars to reap the gold mine that is diverse ideas. At the end of each month, our Managing Editor supervises creation of an article: an objective, unbiased look at that economic sector.<br>
			As President, I oversee and shape every part of this process – from choosing the monthly theme to editing final drafts to guiding our discussions at meetings. My role, while central, isn’t to direct: I’m the throughline that ensures our ideas don’t just stay interesting, but become meaningful.<br><br>
			Before I get going, I should let you know: we don’t just discuss, we compete. My Chief and Assistant Editors aren’t just capable writers: we tackle the technicalities as well.<br><br>
			Thanks so much for stopping by – Josh.

			<b>President: Joshua Liu</b><br>
			Josh is a Senior in the Finance Major at Brooklyn Tech. He spearheaded the founding of the club because he’s ambitious - and not just in achievement. Josh aspires to expand who he is to the fullest: that’s independent academic research on trade, coaching and playing tennis, or even making music at his desk when he probably should be doing homework.<br><br>
			<b>VP / Operations Manager: Shrey Vertes</b><br>
			Shrey is a Senior in the Aerospace Engineering Major at Brooklyn Tech. When he’s not researching planes or analyzing automotive parts or leading the varsity baseball team in his role as captain, he’s devoted to growing COB’s research on the markets that shape his beloved hometown of NYC. When he is not pursuing academics, you can find Shrey eating Indian food and walking his dog Bucki.<br><br>
