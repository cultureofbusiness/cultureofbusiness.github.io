Culture of Business - Minimal React App

Quick local dev instructions

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Pages
- `/` - Home page with intro, article list, and black-box group photo placeholder
- `/about` - About page with lorem ipsum
- `/articles` - List of articles
- `/articles/april` `/articles/may` etc. - Article pages filled with lorem ipsum

Notes
- This is a minimal static scaffold using Vite + React. No backend.
