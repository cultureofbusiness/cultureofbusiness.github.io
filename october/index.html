      New York’s megaprojects are progressing, but not everything is sunshine and rainbows (just take a look around our city). October opened with federal scrutiny that put roughly $18 billion of funding on hold, even as crews stayed active on the Gateway Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway.

      <b>Gateway Hudson Tunnel: advancing, with eyes on cash flow</b><br>
      The Gateway Development Commission reaffirmed the project’s progress, while earlier updates noted tunnel-boring machines neared completion for the New Jersey side. Everything seems to be set for the launching of new excavation projects later in the year. The immediate work continues, but the longer-term outlook depends on an infusion of federal cash.

      <b>Second Avenue Subway Phase 2: East Harlem extension</b><br>
      Phase 2 of this ambitious project extends the Q from 96 St to 125 St, adding new stations at 106 St, 116 St, and 125 St/Lex. Project documentation and federal oversight materials were refreshed this week, underscoring scope and interchanges even as the funding pause raises questions on timing. It’s also worth noting that leading mayoral candidate (now mayor-elect) Zohran Mamdani has expressed support for both the extension and increased subway funding, so significant progress could be made on this project as time progresses.

      <b>Airports: JFK’s New Terminal One & near-term impacts</b><br>
      JFK’s New Terminal One remains a multi-year redevelopment project opening in phases starting 2026, but this month contained temporary detours and pickup changes around T4/T1 as work zones shift. For the airport, October held inconveniences.

      <b>Coastal resiliency & active detours</b><br>
      The East Side Coastal Resiliency project transitioned into Phase 2 in September, with more amenities south of the Williamsburg Bridge reopening. Bike riders now face detours slated to last into 2026, a reminder that climate infrastructure reshapes daily mobility before it fully pays off.
